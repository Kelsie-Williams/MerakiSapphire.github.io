This is a fun and inquisitive quiz web application implemented using Python, Flask, and CSS. The purpose of this quiz is to give the user a music artist their most like and some song recommendations based on it.

When the webpage is first opened the user is prompted to provide a username and password to log in. If the user does not have an account they can click register in the top right corner to make one. If the user attempts to log in without an account an error message will appear starting "invalid username/password."

When register is clicked the register page will appear and the user will be prompted to provide a username, a password, and a confirmation for said password. If the user fails to provide one of those three things or the password and password confirmation don't match an error message will appear stating what's wrong.

Once the user logins or registers the index page will appear and the user will have the option to choose to take the quiz or, if the user has completed the quiz already, go to their song library with their song recommendations based on the music artist their most like.

If the 'take the quiz' option is chosen the quiz page will appear displaying a list of 10 questions for the user to answer. Once the user is done taking the quiz they will press the done button and the result page with their music artist and songs will appear. For each song recommended the user is provided with the song's title, artist, and a youtube link for it.

If the user is to log out and log back in again then can click either the songs library button on the index page or the navigation bar to see their song recommendations again. The user can also retake the quiz and possibly get different results the same way they can revisit their song recommendations with the button on the idex page ot the navigation bar.
